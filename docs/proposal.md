## PROPOSAL FOR CS175 AI PROJECT
#### Met with professor on May 1, 2017


### Summary for Project

    For our project, we chose our agent to solve a Jumping game. The Jumping game has a start and destination. The agent must get from the start to the destination. However, unlike regular mazes, mazes in the Jumping game have missing blocks that the agent fall through. The agent must avoid these gaps the sucessfully reach the destination block. Our input semantics will be the generated maze mission. The agent will not know of its envirnment and only has information about the current state. The output of each mission will be the path the agent found and a cost of the path the agent found from the optimal path. 
    
### AI/ML Algorithms

    We plan on using Monte Claro policy evaluation to find the optimal path of a puzzle. We then hope to use reinforcement learning to train our agent on the optimal path to be able to sovle Jumping puzzles.
    
### Evaluation Plans

    Based on the optimal path and the path given by our agent at the end of the mission, we calculate the cost of the generated path. The reinforcement learning will optimize the cost and converge to an optimal
