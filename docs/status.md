### Project Summary

The goal of JPS remains the same and it is to be able to continue solving <br />
progressingly intricate jumping puzzles. Our base line project, which we <br />
have already achieved, is to solve a small 2D maze (5x4) that is only solveable <br />
through jumping. That is, the AI may choose to walk through the maze <br />
(if it leads to the optimal reward) but it can never reach the destination <br />
block if it does not utilize jumping. Our next milestone is to be able to solve <br />
a small maze with 2 floors (5x4x2). From there on, we will continue to increase <br />
the size of the maze and add more floors. Our moonshot case is for our agent to <br />
be able to solve a large maze with 3 floors (10x10x3).
